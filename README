~~~ Client ~~~

All client code exists in the master-client branch. The master-client branch is
also the branch the CI/CD server points to for production. Any and all changes
that pass the CI build tests will be reflected within the Heroku app.

To deploy the app locally, make sure the .env file's environment variables are
correct for your current setup and you should just have to run:

 npm install
 npm start

We use ESLint to monitor our code quality and style.

Installation and use: https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started

~~~ Server ~~~

All server code exists in the master-server branch. The master-server branch is
also the branch the CI/CD server points to for production. Any and all changes
that pass the CI build tests will be reflected within the Heroku app.

https://image-aggregate-server.herokuapp.com/

To deploy the server locally, make sure the .env file's environment variables
are correct for your current setup and then run:

 export FLASK_APP=api
 export FLASK_ENV=development|production
 pip install setuptools
 pip install -e .
 flask run --cert=cert.pem --key=key.pem

We use Pylint to monitor our code quality and style.

Installation: pip install pylint

Use: http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/run.html

~~~ Linting Practices ~~~

Pylint or ESLint with their default configuration (standard style guide) must be ran (automatically or
manually) on every file created and or edited by a developer.
