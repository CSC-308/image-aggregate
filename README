~~~ Client ~~~

All client code exists in the master-client branch. The master-client branch is
also the branch the CI/CD server points to for production. Any and all changes
pushed will be reflected within the Heroku app.

To deploy the app locally, you should just have to run "npm install" and "npm
start".

We use ESLint to monitor our code quality and style.

Installation and use: https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started

~~~ Python ~~~

We use Pylint to monitor our code quality and style.

Installation: pip install pylint

Use: http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/run.html

Pylint or ESLint with their default configuration (standard style guide) must be ran (automatically or
manually) on every file created and or edited by a developer.
